# Rock, Paper, Scissors
### *A Retro Arcade-Inspired Game*
## Mod 1 Final Solo Project

## Project Overview
For my final Mod 1 solo project, I designed an application that allows a user to play a classic or variation game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer. Designed to take the user back to a simpler time of arcade gaming, the user can choose to play a game with classic characters or mythical creatures.

## Technologies Used
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

## Setup Instructions
* At the top of the repository, click the green Code button
* Copy the `SSH` link in the pop-up window: `git@github.com:stephanieguzm/rock-paper-scissors-project.git`
* Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you want to save the repository in.
* On your command line execute the following commands to open the game:
  * `git clone git@github.com:stephanieguzm/rock-paper-scissors-project.git`
  * `cd rock-paper-scissors`
  * `open index.html`
* Enjoy the game!

## How to Play
* When the browser opens the page, you will be presented with two game options: Classic or Mythical Creatures
* Each game's rules are listed under their game
* Select the game you want to play
* This takes you to the game board
* Click the game fighter of your choice and wait for the computer to randomly choose theirs
* Both fighters appear along with the winner result
* The winner's score updates under their side bar
* In case of a draw, no one scores
* Play as many games as you want
* Click the Change Game button to return to the home view and play a new Classic or Mythical Creatures game
* Take a moment to refresh yourself on the rules and enjoy your new game!
*Your scores will remain on the screen until you refresh or exit the browser*

## Future Features
* Allow the game rules to persist while the user is playing the game
* Reset and clear the score count to 0
* Allow the user to select from a list of avatars to personalize their gaming experience
* Build on the arcade theme by designing the page to look more like a classic arcade game screen

## Reflections
Overall, I am proud of the progress I have made over the last 6 weeks which I was able to demonstrate through building this app. I took time to plan out the functionality of the app and had fun designing its look. My biggest challenge throughout was separating the Data Model and the DOM when building my app. One of my goals for future learning is to continue solidifying my understanding of each, how they work together, and how to best separate them when writing code.
